Django (HTML and CSS)
Objective: Create visually appealing and responsive web pages using Django's templating engine.
Integration: Design a dynamic landing page with HTML and CSS managed by Django.
JavaScript
Objective: Create interactive web elements or a simple game to enhance user interaction.
Integration: Integrate JavaScript with the Django-powered frontend.
Python (Django)
Objective: Build a Django application that automates a repetitive task or solves a real-world problem.
Integration: Leverage Django's ORM and framework features for backend development.

Project Details
C Application
The C application is a command-line tool that demonstrates data structures, algorithms, and memory management. It runs as a separate process and interacts with the Django application via system calls.

Django Application
The Django application consists of models, views, and templates to manage the frontend and backend logic.

Models
YourModel: Represents data entities with fields such as name and created_at.
Views
home: The main view that calls the C application and renders the output on the homepage.
Templates
home.html: The main template that displays the output of the C application and integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Static Files
CSS: Located in portfolio/static/css/.
JavaScript: Located in portfolio/static/js/.
